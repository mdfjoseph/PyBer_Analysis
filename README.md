# PYBER ANALYSIS

# Overview of the Analysis:
The purpose of the analysis is to summarize how data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.  In order to do this analysis the following had to be created:
-  A summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type.
-  Using Panda and Matplotlib, a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

# RESULTS
1.  The ride-sharing data research included total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city types.
2.  According to the data collected, overall, the "Urban" city type has higher fares and those fares consistently stayed above $1,500 throughout the months of January to April.
3.  The fare rankings, by city type, from highest to lowest fares are:  first - Urban, second - Suburban, third - Rurual.

# SUMMARY
The data results show the disparities among the Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities.  Please find below recommendations for consideration:
1.  More research should be done on each city types' population because their tends to be more people living on Urban cities and it is usually less populated Rural cities.
2.  A study of what's in the surrounding area of the city type is important.  People living in Rural cities tend to have to travel further to get to places because everything is spread out.  In the Urban and Suburban cities, most businesses are in a closer proximity and easy to get to.
3.  Research on the Demographics of the poputlation (type of riders) is also important.
